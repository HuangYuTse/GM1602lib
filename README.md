## Getting started

download ZIP and import by Arduino IDE

You can run example file then you will know how to use it

## GM1602
This precision sensor from Honeywell is the best sensing solution for measuring CO gas.

Detect gas : CO (0~1000ppm)

Input voltage : DC5V ± 0.2V

Input current : 5mA

AO output : 

0ppm ±10mV

1000ppm output about 1000mV

1ppm increase about 1mV

Work temperature : -20 ~ 50°C

## Compatibility

It must be work on all arduino board 

You need to initialize  3V or 5V what your ADC Supply voltage
